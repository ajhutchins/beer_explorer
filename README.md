The North Shore Beer Explorer is a website designed for people living, or traveling, to the Boston area. Just north of Boston lies the "North Shore," which has a plethora of breweries. We have listed a few of our favorites on this website and made it possible for the user to view each brewery, our favorite libations from each, edit the breweries, or delete it altogether. Ultimately, we hope be a be a list of sorts for individuals keeping track of their breweries visited.
